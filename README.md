# COBOL-Project-1
This is the first project in my COBOL class and Jacksonville State University.

The purpose of this program is to produce our first report with some simple math to calculate the "total starting salary" and "total current salary" fields for this fictional warehouse.

INPUT FILE - PR1F19.txt
This file contains the employee records for the warehouse. All of the records in the file have the following layout:
  1. Warehouse ID(1-4)
  2. Employee ID(5-9)
  3. Employee Position(10-11)
  4. Employee Last Name(12-21)
  5. Employee First Name(22-31)
  6. Hire Date(35-42)
  7. Starting Salary(43-50)
  8. Date of Last Pay Increase(55-62)
  9. Current Salary(63-70)
  
  The value in parentheses represents the length of fields(minding the empty spaces in the gaps).
  
  OUTPUT FILE - PRDATA.TXT
  
  I have included the output file in the repository. It is worth noting that we did not know about zero supression at the time of writing this and would be first on the list of additions i would make to this file.
  
  PRINTER SPACING CHART - CS370 Program 1 Printer Spacing Chart F19.xls
  
  This file was included with the assignment along with the problem description(CS370 Program 1 Problem Description FA19.docx). The spacing chart was crucial in determining the layout of the Output and served as a guide for the entire program.
